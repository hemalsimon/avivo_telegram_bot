# Risk Management Policy

## Purpose
To identify, assess, and mitigate risks associated with financial operations.

## Key Risk Categories
1.  **Market Risk**: The risk of losses due to movements in market prices. Mitigated by diversification.
2.  **Credit Risk**: The risk of default by borrowers. Mitigated by credit scoring and collateral requirements.
3.  **Liquidity Risk**: The risk of being unable to meet short-term financial obligations. Mitigated by maintaining a 20% cash reserve ratio.
4.  **Operational Risk**: Risk of loss from failed internal processes. Mitigated by regular audits and staff training.

## Mitigation Procedures
- **Stop-Loss Orders**: Implemented on all speculative equity positions to limit downside to 10%.
- **Hedging**: Currency risks for international investments must be 50% hedged using forward contracts.
