# Investment Strategy: Generic Finance Corp (2025)

## 1. Asset Allocation
The recommended asset allocation for the "Moderate Growth" profile is:
- **Equities (Stocks)**: 60% - Focused on global index funds.
- **Fixed Income (Bonds)**: 30% - Government and high-grade corporate bonds.
- **Alternatives**: 10% - Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Commodities.

## 2. Risk Tolerance
Investors should be prepared for a volatility of +/- 15% in any given year.
We recommend a minimum investment horizon of 5-7 years to ride out market cycles.

## 3. Rebalancing
Portfolios are automatically rebalanced quarterly if any asset class deviates by more than 5% from its target allocation.
